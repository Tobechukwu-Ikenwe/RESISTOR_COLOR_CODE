# RESISTOR_COLOR_CODE
This project implements a console-based resistor color code calculator in C. It allows the user to input the four color bands of a resistor (Band 1, Band 2, Multiplier, Tolerance) as strings. The program converts the first two bands into digits, interprets the third band as a multiplier (power of 10), and uses the fourth band to determine tolerance
